# MissionWired Data Engineer Exercise
This repository contains my code and csv output files for MissionWired's data engineering hiring exercise. For ease of use, I have formated my code in both a Python file and a Jupyter Notebook! The Python file is intended for those who want to generate the people.csv and acquisition_facts.csv quickly. Jupyter Notebooks are intended to understand my thought process in how I created the csv files. On the Jupyter Notebooks, there are comprehensive notes and comments on what/why things are being done at each step. I provide examples of how the data looks at each step of transformation. 

## The Repository is structured as follows:

Python File
- [exercise_1_2.py](https://github.com/dugad059/missionwired-data-engineering-project/blob/master/exercise_1_2.py) - Code for Exercise 1 & 2

Jupyter Notebooks
- [exercise_1.ipynb](https://github.com/dugad059/missionwired-data-engineering-project/blob/master/exercise_1.ipynb) - Code for Exercise 1
- [exercise_2.ipynb](https://github.com/dugad059/missionwired-data-engineering-project/blob/master/exercise_2.ipynb) - Code for Exercise 2

Output Files
- [people.csv]() - Output CSV from Exercise 1
- [acquisition_facts.csv]() - Output CSV from Exercise 2

## How to run locally
The repository can be cloned in order to run the file and notebooks on your local machine.

Dependencies
- [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html) 

Running Python File
- In you command line, run 'python exercise_1_2.py'

Running Jupyter Notebook
- Open [exercise_1.ipynb](https://github.com/dugad059/missionwired-data-engineering-project/blob/master/exercise_1.ipynb) and run blocks in order.
- Once the people.cvs file is save from [exercise_1.ipynb](https://github.com/dugad059/missionwired-data-engineering-project/blob/master/exercise_1.ipynb), Open [exercise_2.ipynb](https://github.com/dugad059/missionwired-data-engineering-project/blob/master/exercise_2.ipynb) and run blocks in order!
